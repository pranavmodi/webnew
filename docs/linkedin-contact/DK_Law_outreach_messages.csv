Thought you'd find this useful: https://getpossibleminds.com/healthcare-case-study","Hi Daniel - we helped a CA imaging center you may work with transform their patient support. Here's the story: https://getpossibleminds.com/healthcare-case-study","Hi Daniel - I'm Pranav from Possible Minds. I noticed DK Law works extensively with personal injury cases across Southern California, and I wanted to reach out because you may have interacted with one of our clients - a California-based medical imaging company we've been helping with their support operations.

We built AI systems that handle their patient inquiries and email volume (600+ daily). The results have been significant - 62% reduction in support workload and 41% improvement in patient satisfaction.

Given your firm's volume and the coordination required with imaging providers, I thought you might find the case study interesting: https://getpossibleminds.com/healthcare-case-study

Happy to chat if it's relevant to how your team works with providers.","Hi Daniel - I'm Neha, one of the engineers at Possible Minds. I wanted to reach out because your firm may have worked with a California medical imaging company we've been helping.
